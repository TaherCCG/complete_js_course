// REST pattern is used to collect multiple elements and condense them into an array.  It can only be used in the last element of the destructuring assignment.  The spread operator is used to expand an array into individual elements.  It can be used in any place in the destructuring assignment.

// Spread and REST both look exactly the same, but they are exact opposites.  Spread is used on the right side of the assignment operator and REST is used on the left side of the assignment operator.  Spread is used to unpack an array and REST is used to pack elements into an array.

// Spread is used where we would otherwise write values separated by commas.  REST is used where we would otherwise write variable names separated by commas.
